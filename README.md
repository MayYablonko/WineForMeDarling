# WineForMeDarling

WineForMeDarling is a Python script that automates the process of loading your member card on the "יין בעיר" store's website using your תןביס card details. The script utilizes Selenium WebDriver to interact with the website and the `win10toast` library to send a desktop notification to the user. The automation is done with scheduling the script to run to your liking with the Windows' Task Scheduler.
